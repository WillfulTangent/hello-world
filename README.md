# hello-world
Im WillfulTangent. Im a Youtuber with a desire to learn more about computers and how the function, and perform tasts. Computers are fascinating to me and i build them regularly. However, the same questions always persist: How does it really work? I know the components required for certain situations but im here to learn the in and outs. Im not exceptionally gifted in Mathematics, so this does seem a bit daunting.
